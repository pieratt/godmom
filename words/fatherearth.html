  <p> Sharp red leaves on neon sky. The wind kicked, trees clawed, thick clouds glowered. There was a face in the sky I'd never seen, it was an aspect of nature I’d never felt. Angry, threatening, an arrogant presence that had come home to remind everyone of how badly they’d fucked up. It felt like a dad, my dad, and nature was now permeated with a truth I’d never recognized: the hard truths of being a man and and a son are as natural and integrated into nature as the whole of the world, including motherhood or the moon or gods or math or children or violence or shadow. 
  </p>
  <p>Why aren't men associated with the Earth? Men “get” God Himself, of course, but you’ll note that He sits quite literally on a (human-made) throne in a (disconnected) sky. Talk to a western believer and you will find out very quickly that God is specifically removed from anything planetary, local, muddy, dirty.  
  </p>
  <p><span class="pullquote">We have no healthy, elegant, aspirational archetypes or mythologies which directly associate men with Earth in the same way that women “get to” have Her as one of their archetypes.</span> We have the Green Man, a chaos agent with few aspirational qualities. Even Odin, a wonderful combination of feminine wisdom and masculine action, is sacrificed ~on the tree, and is never identified with the larger cosmos as such.
  </p>
  <p>To what degree does this lack of a symbol or myth speak to the disembodied nature of the Western man? Of course we abuse the Earth if we feel no attachment to it, to our bodies, to our intuition and what our gut has to say. How different would our relationship with the planet be if a primary symbol of manhood were an archetypal planetary symbol? Imagine Zeus and Gaia as a single concept. We know this is possible because we already have one in the form of Mother Earth, a fantastically rich and dynamic symbol which we carry in our hearts and which shapes our relationship with both women and the Earth. Inversely, of course men will subjugate the Earth to our whim if we think of the Earth as a woman, isn’t the leadership of men<sup>1</sup> one of the primary tenants of our judeo-christian literature? 
  </p>
  <p>As someone fascinated by cosmologies and the concepts which bind us and who works professionally in words and symbols and culture and product development, the truth of this absent father felt like an opportunity I could actually speak into. The notion of developing a brand or product line which built cool, healthy, tasteful, interesting, provocative associations between masculinity and The Earth, felt like an obvious Good Idea, so I began to pursue it in earnest.

   <p> In this era, entertainment and brands hold the role in culture once held by gods and religion. If you want to affect culture, you can either start a brand or create something entertaining. Launch a movie or a product line, either one will give you access to the unconscious of millions wherein you can build up additional habits with apps, services, merch, all kinds of lifestyle choices that, again, used to be the domain of religion and family.
    </p>
    <p>“Father Earth” itself is not a product, it's a concept, so if I wanted to see more of it in the market, I would need to attach it to something cool which could travel our distribution networks and spread the message. This was 2016 and cannabis legalization was starting to roll across the country. Big Name Cannabis Brands felt inevitable, Busch acquisitions and national campaigns felt inevitable. Father Earth as a cannabis brand which provided a great product while inventing and scaling a new mythology of some kind of Masculine Planet symbol, took immediately hold in my mind.
    </p>
    <p>A few hundred sketches later and I'd shared the idea with friends, an old forum. The response was negative, with a few pockets of proclamaitions of brilliance, the feedback largely centering around misogyny, colonialism and hints of fascism... which... I mean it really seemed to drive the point home.</p>
    <p>Over time, I began to agree. An ominous "Fatherland" local street sign pushed me over the edge of agreement. As much as I loved the intention and name, the power dynamic of using the word "Father" to attempt to productize and occupy an existing feminine archetype's space became too obvious of a misstep, too symptomatic of the absence it was trying to fill. The more I considered the problem, the more this didn't seem to be something I could tackle head on at all.</p>

    <p class="footnote"><sup>1</sup> <span class="italic">"isn’t the leadership of men one of the primary tenants of our judeo-christian literature?"</span> I've theories on this which I'll talk about later: TLDR — I suspect the way men and women are handled by the church is utterly at odds with their intended use as descriptions  Masculine-Yang and Feminine-Yin properties - the feminine literally cannot give sermons because sermons are linear directed speach, Yin and Leadership are effectively antonyms. And if not a misunderstanding, then it is at least a fascinating opportunity for evolution.</p>
