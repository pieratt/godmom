      2016-2018<br><br></h1>
  
  </p><p>The landscape and everything in it seems to be accelerating. Tech speeding up, wealth disparity speeding up, fear of the future on the rise. Acceleration itself, increasing. All except the human spirit. Our spirit, our sense of purpose, seems to be hiding behind the sciences that support us, looking embarrassed of itself, weighed down by the fear that we've fried our brains with feeds while breaking our planet with industry.
  </p><p>No moonshots in sight, no collective purpose to speak of, we've atomized and optimized for logical, individualized identity for so long that our collective sense of self, our beautiful, illogical, impossible dreams and mythologies have slowly fallen out of date.
  </p><p>Let us give endless thanks to the wave on wave of architects, scientists, storytellers, mothers, hunters, fathers, builders, engineers, mathematicians and logicians that brought us to these shores of soulful machines and unparalleled human autonomy. Somehow though, despite the best intentions of our best minds, technological connection has come hand in hand with cultural disconnection. After 10,000 years of centralization, we live in a global arena of isolated souls yelling at whoever is fair game that day. The potential for shared purpose is as obvious as it is absent. 
  </p><p>The frontier is online. Will be online indefinitely. After 3 decades we’re still exploring the potential of HTTP, and multiplayer gaming is an endless grid of creative and social potential. The internet is perpetually novel, 24/7, practically omnipotent and certainly omnipresent. A layer of abstraction that mediates a planet's worth of social interactions, from finance to romance. 
  </p><p>Yet, the digital realm remains unmentioned by our holy texts and is unaddressed by our belief systems.
  </p><p>It's no wonder our collective body feels lost. We live in the era before the next upgrade, before our spiritual software has had time to sync with our sensory hardware. Western Christianity has beautiful roots but runs on vulnerable legacy code. Eastern philosophy holds endless wisdom but is difficult for Western minds. /S/ Science avoids Purpose. Esotericism is Occulted. Modern philosophy claims no responsibility to common cause and our national stories run on reactive short-term cycles. 
  </p><p>To feel no compatibility between purpose and modern life is inevitable. The spiritual market needs new options that speak to the modern mind and our decentralized souls. For hundreds of thousands of years we sat around the fire every night with our families and cousins and friends. Ancient tribal living had its problems but lack of connection and purpose and place were not among them. We knew our place like we knew ourselves. Now, we accept the lack of community and shared purpose as though it is natural. It is right and true and fair to feel out of sync, to feel the absence of something you cannot name because we have never had it.
  </p><p>Looking back to the landscape, our human campfire huddled to one side, tech rewriting the horizon in real time. Acceleration isn't stopping, the gulf between spirit and technology is widening. After years of setting up camp in this new world, a new valley has opened and we've met the native life form. With AI among us, threatening to outsmart us, digital now feels threatening in a way that was previously only depressing. The global network that unites us and the tech we’ve built with it now presents more of an existential crisis than ever. Suddenly it feels immensely important to band together, to build and run systems which synchronize our sense of purpose again, in a way we haven’t tried in too long. 
  </p><p>The lack of spiritual alignment in our lives isn't our fault, but it is in our hands to turn the wheel and it is in our hearts to find a way. We can step onto the right path for a new era of personal fulfillment with a few early steps: Centralize the online spiritual market, modernize ancient wisdom into palatable new code, and consecrate digital spaces with spiritual experience. 
  </p><p>1. Centralize. Centralize online healers and spiritual wisdom. There are two aspects to this notion of centralization, one is practical and one is abstract. Practically, putting all the same resources into a shared list for the sake of easy discovery is a time-honored tradition online, it simply hasn’t been applied to the mystical healing market, yet. Abstractly, centralization implies a level of mutual respect and admiration that the market doesn’t not currently demonstrate. If you can envision an online space which supports healers of distinct Christian, Muslim, Zen, lineages, then you can also envision a space wherein said healers respect each other’s unique calling, cosmology, and are able to work ecologically as one part of the solution to the existential question. One of the most important steps in the evolution of spirituality that we can help kick off is for the different Faiths to recognize the integral validity of the other without fear of losing their own integrity while pursuing the healing of the masses in unison. God speaks to different cultures differently, it is self-evident. Our era of social networks and shared platforms sets the context for a centralization of our spiritual lineages into a common platform, so that a suffering individual may find their own golden path and approach divine healing as fluidly as possible, without the heavy friction of mutual obfuscation.
  </p><p>The world is full of people who are gifted in the art of listening, healing, guiding, supporting. Many of these healers have moved their businesses online, able to offer their services worldwide through remote video. The barrier between the wounded and those who can help them is no longer a matter of cultural or technical barrier, we simply need to build the bridge between them. 
  </p><p>The simple act of centralizing global service providers of different religious, mystic, spiritual, healing practices into a common interface will do wonders to not only improve the inner quality of life for a population’s worth of suffering, it will set the stage for a new age of spirituality where interfaith collaboration and respect becomes a new norm.
  </p><p>2. Modernize. Modernize ancient wisdom. In mystical traditions the Self is both synonymous {non-dual} and harmonious {dualistic} with the cosmos according to the perennial spiritual tenants of the Golden Rule (symmetrical, relational) and As Above So Below (fractal, holographic). Mysticism has provided guidance on how to think about the world in a way that places oneself in a sovereign relationship with one’s own simulation for thousands of years. Translating ancient wisdom into modern verse is to provide ourselves with new existential tools and language. More needs to be said here. A few further thoughts: Φ Eligen - Operating Theory or Why Mysticism
  </p><p>3. Consecrate. Consecrate new digital spaces. We need to build culture that recognizes the legitimacy and therefore holiness of the existing digital experience. A 24/7 shared meditative experience supportive of different faiths is something that any citizen of the internet should be able to step into. A wikipedia for peace, a feed that nurtures, a temple in the sky for anyone to step into when needed. By recognizing the natural beauty of the digital landscape through native forms of worship in this manner, it also seems possible that our impression of the rest of the web may elevate by association. 
  </p><p>The intensity of twitter rage or the family zoom proclaim a new truth, which is that our spiritual, emotional, mental selves, that our experiences of love and mind and purpose, can be converted into zeros and ones and piped through underground cables around the world. Our databases are already stuffed with new horizons, we simply need to build software which sees them and addresses our dreams with humility and form-giving aesthetics.
  </p><p>Any of these three concepts represent a platform’s worth of projects in and of themselves. There is so much to do. We are emerging from a scientific age where spirituality is taboo and we live at the beginning of digital history, where everything is still being tried for the first time. This online world we begrudgingly call home is only a few generations old. Ours is a unique moment, witness to a landscape which will evolve and define humanity for eons to come. 
  </p><p>It is time for spiritual systems which speak to the truths of our starless sky. Let us use our scientific minds to rediscover our spiritual inheritance all over again, with new symbols fashioned in our own manner that we may see ourselves reflected in the eternal once again. 
  </p><p>The time and thought you’ve given is deeply appreciated, thank you.
