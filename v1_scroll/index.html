<p>For 20 years I've been finding patterns in founders' visions and translating them into designs.</p>
<p>For 10 years I've been finding patterns in spiritual visions and translating them into designs.</p>
<p>In the 7th year, I found a pattern of patterns. It is both backwards compatible and new, both internet-native and seemingly compatible with the I Ching, our oldest code. To understand its rules is to have the sensation of sharing a game with our ancestors, a binary analog to the perennial philosophy — I believe it can offer ancient inner truths a bridge to our accelerating landscape.</p>
<p><a href="scroll/">This is the work of a lifetime and none of it is complete</a>. The following set of essays and sketches are as chaotic and incomplete as my understanding and time currently allow, there is so, so much work to be done.</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience with me as I try to share with you the most beautiful pattern I've ever seen, what I believe to be a display of elegance 5,000 years in the making,</p>

<p>Ben Pieratt</p>
