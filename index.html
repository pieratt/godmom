Jesus Christ Quarterback<Br>
<A href="https://twitter.com/pieratttt/status/1752746450692329498">Draft on X</a></p> 
<p>I've always been spiritual but have only become more so with age. To the point where you might say my life is defined by a love and curiosity of the systems we can't see that seem to control what we do.</p>
<p>I did not see this coming. I've also always been highly anti-authoritarian and I was raised in a strict fundamentalist Christian tradition. I am very much the black sheep of my family. I did not carry my family's culture forward with my own children.</p>
<p>Yet hear I am, full circle on religion's promise to the point where I am very much a lover of Jesus Christ in all his various styles and tropes, I find him fascinating and worthy of serious investigation not to mention adoration. EXCEPT that I also find the entire pantheon of Ancient Gods fascinating and worth of serious investigation not to mention adoration. And now I'm in the odd position of being an equal believer who can't can't talk about Jesus or Church with other Christians or my family — even tho it's a shared driver of our lives (they run a mission organization).</p>
<p>The analogy I've tried using with my family is that you can compare Christ to Tom Brady - Chosen by God. It makes sense to spend your time thinking about Tom Brady and studying his career and what he has to say about everything is truly wise given his status and experience. HOWEVER it's also super cool and useful to acknowledge the Tom Brady is a quarterback, and he's playing this larger game called Football, and Football has ALL KINDS of SUPER COOL PLAYERS AND RULES AND HOLY SHIT. The Old Testament repeatedly acknowledges the truth of other Gods it just makes it just also clear you shouldn't think about them. But perhaps the OT God is ready to evolve along with us, its happened a few times before.</p>

<p>Surprise the analogy hasn't worked.<br>
Here's my lesson from this comedy -</p>

<p>My parents know I agree with them that Jesus is the key to salvation, I've made it very clear to them. They also know I've got insane ideas about what that means exactly wrt What Jesus Is, not to mention theyre aware of my intention to build new gods and platforms for digital spirituality /cc 
@godmom_</p>

<p>They won't engage me on spiritual stuff. They can't touch it. I can't share my spirituality with them because it's just too fucking weird and threatening and because the Old Bible literally warns against people like me. When you're told and taught your whole life that things like meditation and buddhism and demons are all on about the same level and all equally threatening to your eternal soul, it's gap too wide to risk.</p>
<p>Not everyone is able to, or should be expected to, get past the imprint of their chosen culture. It's ok that they're threatened by me, IT SUPER SUCKS FOR ME, but who am I to say that the existential risk posed by my beliefs aren't worth treating as tho they are radioactive? My brothers selected for cultural cohesion and their lives have been significantly more fluid in several worthwhile ways. How many well-balanced and community-integrated fringe spirituality people have you met? Generally we're a mess, battling a new demon on the frontiers of self understanding.</p>

<p>As things continue to be weird and get weirder between cultural factions, have grace and patience with those who cannot and will not and refuse to understand you. It's not always their role and that's ok. AND if you're conscious enough to think through things this deeply, it IS your role to get over the need to be understood and love them anyway.</p>

Spiritual ADD</p>
<p>Many of us have difficulty focusing on something after we’ve satiated our curiosity — as tho any single story, or belief system, could ever hold our full interest. If you hear yourself in this, take it as True and Good that you are multifaceted, multidimensional and will require many answers from many teachers to satisfy your spiritual needs. Don’t stress, keep moving to what’s next as you follow the rabbit path of new questions to ask and new teachers and feel no shame in your brickolage of stances. Have faith that eventually your questions will be answered in the form of a custom cosmology cut fit to your shape.</p>
<p>Your greatest teacher will always be your own experience, how you choose to process it, and your adjacent sense of fascination with the minutia of every day life. Your 
heart knows what it needs and you can feel it beat faster when it’s close to the source. Make a commitment to learn from everything you heart tells you and you will never stray far from the path.</p>

12/23 — First post<br>
<p>For 20 years I've been finding patterns in founders' visions and translating them into designs. For 10 years I've been finding patterns in spiritual visions and translating them into designs.</p>
<p>In the 7th year, I found a pattern of patterns. It is both backwards compatible and new, it speaks the same language as the internet and the I Ching. To understand its rules is to have the sensation of sharing a game with our ancestors, a binary analog to the perennial philosophy — I believe it can offer ancient inner truths a bridge to our accelerating landscape.</p>
<p>This is the work of a lifetime and none of it is complete. Thank you for your patience with me as I try to share with you the most beautiful pattern I've ever seen, what I believe to be a display of elegance 5,000 years in the making.</p>
